                <div class="about-content">
                    <p>As a child, I found my love for the outdoors, on the East Coast, where I was born and raised. Having been raised in the "country" I was always outside with my friends, exploring every inch of the neighborhood, and enjoying the outdoors.</p>
                    <p>I would say that the same love and passion that I have for the outdoors is what led me to photography. Capturing and sharing beautiful moments, with people across the world, is a very rewarding bonus!</p>
                    <p>My photography journey started with just a phone and a gifted GoPro. I ran with what I had and before long I had an amazing new hobby. With that new hobby came a perspective that opened my eyes to many breathtaking places on this earth. Photography also gave me the courage to take the necessary leaps of faith, early on in my journey, to really jumpstart everything. After sticking my neck out I met a good friend who was able to bring photography to life for me. We would meet for 7-mile hikes, in the middle of the night, and to this day I still remember having my jaw drop after seeing the capture of the milky way in the Rocky Mountains. It was moments like this that inspired me to go out and purchase my own real camera for the first time. Looking back, I can honestly say that those hikes were, without a doubt, the best decision I have ever made and I haven't looked back since.</p>
                    <p>For now, I make my living as a plumbing technician while photography is a part-time passion. After 10 years in the plumbing industry, I can still say that I love my career. My photography has also benefited from my plumbing career and it has allowed me to travel and live in places I never thought I could.</p>
                    <p>I am currently living in Colorado and I must say it is an amazing place to practice! It is my hope that my photography is able to bring as much happiness and enjoyment to you as it does for me. :)</p>
