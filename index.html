                    <p>As a child, I found my love for the outdoors as most people do.. as a child! After high school I moved out to Colorado and found myself more in love with the Rocky Mountains. Rock climbing, hiking, you name it, I wanted a piece of it. Although responsibilities changed since my childhood, I know I can still find peace when wandering through the woods.</p>
                    <p>I would say that love and passion for the outdoors has led me to love my new passion as a landscape photographer. While capturing intense and beautiful moments are fun alone, sharing these pictures and bringing them to life for my viewers, is a very rewarding bonus!!</p>
                    <p>My photography journey started with a phone like most, until I was gifted my very first "Go-Pro". From there it took off. I was living in Charleston, South Carolina at the time and found myself starting to wake up early and head to the beach before anyone else got there. With this new hobby just getting started I knew I wanted more, which led me back to Colorado. I met one of my very best friends to this day through the social media app Instagram, Brandon. He was the one who truly opened my eyes to this new hobby I had picked up. We took a hike one night, 5 miles into the Rockies at 8pm in hopes to capture the milky way. Standing at the edge of Lake Dorothy at 12am, I heard his camera click and a picture appeared on his screen. My mouth hit the ground. I had never seen anything like this before in my life and at that moment I knew that next day I was purchasing my first camera! Looking back, I can honestly say that those hikes were without a doubt, the best decision I have ever made and I havent looked back since.</p>
                    <p>For now I make my living serving the community of Salt Lake City, Utah as a Plumbing Technician. After 11 years in the plumbing industry I can still say that I love my career. My photography has also benefited from my career and has allowed me to move and live in places I never thought I would be in life. </p>
                    <p>It is my hope that my photography is able to bring out the adventure in yourself and also bring happiness to you, as it does me! :) </p>
